# Timeline Project (ChronoCanvas) 

## Description
This Interactive Timeline Application is a dynamic tool for creating, viewing, and managing timelines --- with flexibility to work well for other types of mapping. Developed as part of my portfolio, it showcases my understanding and skills in React, UI/UX design, and interactive web development. It is concurrently built on pure front-end skills, with goals to improve and evolve the app with time.
